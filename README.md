# sbt-hackling

Hackathon implementation of the Libling concept. It's a prototype. It works, but exactly what and how works might break at any time.

This is an experimental platform. You are encouraged to submit changes. Almost anything will be accepted without much fuss.

## Libling

Libling is a way to add dependencies to your project as plain Scala sources. 
It is intended for simple snippets of code or small libraries (for now).

## Motivation

* Publishing simple libraries is unnecessarily hard in JVM land. Why not just push to GitHub and be done with it?
* Even when code is source compatible with multiple Scala versions, need to cross-build it. Makes builds more complicated!
* With scala.js and Scala Native, even more cross building is necessary!
* Classical major.minor.bugfix versioning is a hack! A git commit graph is closer to what's going on, a commit hash uniquely identifies a version and its history.
* take advantage of distributed VCS possibilities. Cloning a repo mirrors all the versions so far, can be cached. Does not require single-source-of-truth centralized infrastructure. This makes forking trivial.

Actually the latter two are the true motivation and the first three are a way to justify a practical experiment

## Features

* declare dependencies on liblings in your `build.sbt` via git commit hash
* a commit hash may be resolved from remote and local repos
* dependencies are resolved transitively
* repos are cached locally
* install them as sources, including markdown docs

## Still kind of missing features

* friendly version resolution via tags and branches
* friendly DSL
* finding and resolving dependency conflicts by eviction or something
* resolving conflicts by rewriting packages
* a way to upgrade dependencies automatically
* automatic index of liblings with a task to publish a libling
* (maybe) resolving binary dependencies. For now it's assumed a libling only depends on the Scala stdlib.

## Not in scope

* advanced builds. Liblings have a fixed structure and only depend on other liblings. 
  But your build can depend on both liblings and regular binary libraries.

## To use a libling

Add this plugin:

    resolvers += Resolver.bintrayIvyRepo("jastice","sbt-plugins")
    addSbtPlugin("libling" % "sbt-hackling" % "0.2.1")

Add a libling source dependency:
       
    sourceDependencies += Dependency(
            Version("<git commit long hash>"),
            Repositories(uri("<https git repository uri>")))
            
On the sbt shell:

    > liblingInstall
    
This will:

* cache repos locally in `<user home>/.libling/cache`
* copy sources and docs out of the repos into your project under `target/libling/`
* generate a `/libling` directory in your project that contains a lock file that exactly identifies the commit hashes you depend on and the repos where they were found


## Examples
    
* [Skeleton](https://github.com/libling/libling-skeleton) - a minimal libling example
* [Libling with dependencies](https://github.com/libling/libling-with-dependencies) - includes Skeleton as a dependency
* [Libling with transitive dependencies](https://github.com/libling/libling-with-transitive-dependencies) - includes the libling with dependencies directly and the Skeleton transitively

    
## To create a libling

    sbt new libling/libling.g8
    
See [libling.g8](https://github.com/libling/libling.g8) for details.
    
    
### structure

A libling is just a bunch of code in a certain structure. When you include a libling into your sbt project, 
some code gets dumped into your `/target/libling` directory and becomes part of your build.

* `README.md` documentation root. can link to further docs in `/doc` directory.
* `/src`
    Contains plain Scala sources, no main/ test/ etc. Always included on libling resolution. We'll figure out later how to build more complicated stuff.
* `/doc`
    .md sources - included by default.
* `/libling`
    * `lock`: the libling's own libling dependencies, including transitive dependencies.
    Commit hashes only. These are generated by the `liblingUpdate` task and should not be manually edited.
    A libling can only depend on other liblings. We'll figure out how to handle necessary binary deps (e.g. scala version) later. HOCON format.
    * `meta`: useful metadata where to look up the commit hashes. Can be generated by `liblingGenerateMetadata` task. HOCON format.
* `/test`
    * tests go in here. Not included as dependency by default.
    
    
## Inspirations

* [microlib](https://github.com/jessitron/microlib): same basic idea in Clojure
* [Gistard](https://gist.github.com/viktorklang/a09aad920c1a4072cfe6): depend on gists
